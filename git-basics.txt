- Git is a version control tool that helps developers track changes in their files and code over time.
- It has three main areas: the working directory, the staging area, and the local repository.
- Using `git add`, a developer selects which changes should be saved.
- With `git commit`, they save a snapshot of the project along with a short message.
- Branches let developers experiment with new ideas without affecting the main version of the code.
